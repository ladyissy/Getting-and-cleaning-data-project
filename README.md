# Getting-and-cleaning-data-project
This repository holds the R code and documentation for the Getting and Cleaning data project (week 4).

#Files
1. Codebook.md describes variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
2. run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in several steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.
3. tidyset.txt is the output of running the R code. It can be found under this repository too.
